## Introduction

I'm a student at [HUTECH](https://www.hutech.edu.vn), majoring in Software Engineering. I improve my skills by working on pet projects with my friends at [Owlvernyte](https://github.com/Owlvernyte). I often take on frontend tasks for these projects, but I would love to spend more time on backend tasks. Additionally, I enjoy creating Discord bots using discord.js.

These are the areas I am familiar with (including what I've learned from school and self-study):

- **Web Development**

  - JavaScript, TypeScript
  - React, Next.js
  - Express.js
  - ASP.NET Core
  - Java Spring Boot

- **Mobile Development**

  - Flutter
  - Java Android

- **DevOps**
  - Docker
  - Apache, Nginx, Caddy
