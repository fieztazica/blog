## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Who am I?

I'm a final-year student at [HUTECH](https://www.hutech.edu.vn), majoring in Software Engineering. I improve my skills by working on pet projects with my friends at [Owlvernyte](https://github.com/Owlvernyte). I often take on frontend tasks for these projects, but I would love to spend more time on backend tasks. Additionally, I enjoy creating Discord bots using discord.js.

These are the areas I am familiar with (including what I've learned from school and self-study):

- **Web Development**: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Express.js, NestJS, ASP.NET Core, Java Spring Boot
- **Mobile Development**: Flutter, Android Java
- **DevOps**: Docker, Apache, Nginx, Caddy

## üöó Milestones

I'm still writing my own story... üòä
