This video is a group project presentation focused on Bugzilla, a popular open-source bug tracking system. The presentation is divided into four parts, each handled by a team member:

1. **Pham Huynh Nhat Truong** introduces the topic, providing an overview of Bugzilla and its importance in software development and testing workflows.
2. **Nguyen Quoc Kha** covers the installation process and setting up the development environment for Bugzilla.
3. **Huynh Nhat Truong** demonstrates how to deploy Bugzilla using IIS and configure it to run correctly on a local server.
4. **Hoang Tien Dat** (me) provides a practical guide on how to use Bugzilla — including creating and managing bugs, assigning tasks, and tracking issue progress.

The video serves as a complete beginner-friendly guide for students and new developers to understand the basic setup and usage of Bugzilla in real-world projects.
