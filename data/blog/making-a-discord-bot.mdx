## Intro

While you are hanging out with your friends on Discord, you suddenly find a great bot but some of it's features require a premium subscription and you're broke.

Knowing a little bit of Javascript and Node.js, you decide to dig through the entire Internet to find a good, simple Discord bot template but there are so many choices.

To meet your needs, [NamVr's DiscordBot Template](https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template) is the best solution.

## Step by step

### Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= v18 ([NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [Volta](https://volta.sh/) are good choices if you know what are these).
- Your favorite Text Editor (mine is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
- A Discord application created on [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Getting things ready

Head to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Install the template

```bash
# Simply clone the template to your favorite directory:
git clone https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template my-bot
cd my-bot
npm install
```

### Config your bot

Now rename the `config-example.json` file to `config.json` and Paste all stored contents from [Getting things ready](#getting-things-ready) to `config.json`.

```json
{
  "prefix": "!",
  "token": "your-bot-token",
  "owner": "your-id",
  "client_id": "client-id",
  "test_guild_id": "your-server-id"
}
```

### Run the bot

```bash
npm start

# "Started refreshing application (/) commands."
# "Successfully reloaded application (/) commands."
# "Ready! Logged in as My Bot"
```

Test the bot in your Discord Server by typing `!ping` and check if it responds or not. `Pong` means you are good to go!

## Conclusion

Your bot is now ready! Bot commands are stored in the `commands` folder by category. There are some example commands in `commands/misc` like `ping` and `help` (`reload` is used to update the latest version of the command source code). Feel free to edit those commands to fit your needs and create more if you want additional functionality!
